I have about 9 years of experience building and delivering software for multiple big tech companies throughout my career. In my free time I like working on open source projects.I have been interested in tech and working with computers since my high school days. As I started working, I inevitably ended up funding my hobby and now I run my own homelab/servers in my basement. The setup is basically recycled enterprise servers with truenas as my file server, proxmox as my hypervisor, and Kubernetes cluster to host services like plex, nextcloud, homeassistant, ELK stack, Grafana, Prometheus and a lot more applications. Most of my networking gear is from Ubiquiti (was a pfsense person earlier). The homelab setup is mostly like a playground for me which have allowed me to learn and explore areas of technology/ideas which I wouldnâ€™t be exposed to otherwise. Recently I have also been experimenting with home assistant for home automation."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/><meta property="twitter:image" content="/social-image.png"/><meta property="og:image" content="/social-image.png"/><title>Anas AlJabri</title><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.69cba7d3.js"></script><link href="/static/css/main.fe927caf.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
